# Access Management Dashboard with Generative AI

This Power BI dashboard was developed during my internship at **Bajaj Finserv** to monitor and manage access compliance for Onroll and Offroll employees. The dashboard ensures that all mandatory attributes—such as ID type, company, account expiry, and password settings—are validated to determine the compliance status of each user.

## 🔍 Overview

The dashboard simplifies access management by automating compliance logic and providing clear visibility into completed and incomplete records. It also leverages **Power BI Copilot** to enable natural language queries via the Q&A feature, making data insights more accessible to non-technical users.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Tracks compliance status as "Completed" or "Incomplete"
- 🔁 Implements rule-based logic (no AI/ML models used)
- 📊 Built entirely in Power BI
- 🗂️ Uses dummy dataset stored on SharePoint (original project used Azure Data Lake and Databricks)
- 💬 Integrates Power BI Copilot for Generative AI Q&A functionality
- 🚫 No APIs or alerting mechanisms used
- 📈 Focus on workspace capacity monitoring within Power BI


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Power BI Service
- Power BI Copilot (Q&A)
- SharePoint (for data hosting)
- Azure Data Lake & Databricks (original version)

## 📌 Note

This repository contains a **dummy version** of the dashboard due to data confidentiality. All logic and structure are replicated from the original project created at Bajaj Finserv.
